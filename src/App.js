/***
 * Even though this is more or less a single page application, each fold is sectioned off as its own page, 
 * and this is all organized from the "HomePage" component. 
 * 
 * To add any images, we recommend uploading them to the images folder (please feel free to delete or restructure this folder if you like,
 * but this may require looking at every fold with image imports to ensure these aren't messed up.)
 * 
 * To alter the services offered, navigate to the services file in the models folder and make any changes to images, text, etc
 * To change the order they're diplayed on the page, change the order in which they are "pushed" to the array
 * 
 * To add any other pages (for instance, a page about staff for when a second physio is brought in), said component will need to be added here
 *  as a route and to the NavBar as a Link, like the AboutPage is
