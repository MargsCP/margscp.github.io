              I'm Margie Clarke (BSc Physiotherapy (UCT) ), the proud owner of
              Clarke Physiotherapy, with over a decade of expertise and a
              passion for holistic healing. <br></br>
              <br></br> As a dedicated physiotherapist, I thrive on
              problem-solving and having a deep understanding of each patient's
              unique journey. I believe that everyone's healing journey is a
              personalized process and may not be linear. I aim to educate and
              guide you through your healing and rehabilitation process with
              empathy and compassion.<br></br>
              <br></br> I believe in looking at the body as a whole,
              understanding that everything is connected and influences how we
              feel and move. My goal is to empower individuals, helping them
              live their best life and enjoy activities they love. By
              considering the body's interconnectedness, I aim to improve
              overall function and promote a sense of well-being.<br></br>
              <br></br>
              Beyond the walls of the practice, you'll often find me enjoying
              the perks of Cape Town, whether it's exploring scenic hiking
              trails, swinging a racket on the tennis court, or engaging in a
              game of padel. Moreover, my passions extend beyond physical
              activities â€“ I am an enthusiastic food and travel lover, finding
              immense joy in discovering new culinary experiences and exploring
              different cultures.<br></br>
